        <h3>Getting oh-my-zsh to work in Linux</h3>
        <p>
            Prereq:
                <br>apt-get install zsh
                <br>apt-get install git-core
            <br><br>Getting zsh to work in ubuntu is weird, since sh does not understand the source command. So, you do this to install zsh
                <br>wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh
            <br><br>and then you change your shell to zsh
                <br>chsh -s `which zsh`
            <br><br>and you can change your zsh to shell
                <br>chsh -s $(which bash)
            <br><br>and then restart
                <br>sudo shutdown -r 0
